The app basically fetches canteens and their corresponding meals from the OpenMensa-API and lets the user select, browse and filter those. At the time I included the Vue-files via CDN and wrote the app entirely as one index.html file. It worked okay, but as you might guess this is a nice approach for a small prototype to test the framework,\nbut in terms of structure, readabilty and extensibility a middle-scaled catastrophe. As I progressed in my work with frontend-development and especially within Vue I gained some experience and made a note in the back of my mind to re-write this nice application in the proper Vue-way some day.\nCurrently I am in my exam-phase from university and had a bit of stress, but I did the rewrite now anyway and had some fun, also the application runs a bit better now, is open to more development and looks a lot better!')]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"the-implementation"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#the-implementation"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" The implementation")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Here is what I did:")]),e._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[e._v("Re-wrote the app with using .vue-components and a proper stucture")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("implemented some small new features")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("used Vuetify Material Design components (again)")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("used webpack as minifier and bundler")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v('set up proper github-pages branch and "deploy-pipeline" (a shell script lol)')])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("As already said, Im proud of this new better and more stable version, that allows implementing new features way easier.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Here is what it looks like now:\n"),a("img",{attrs:{src:"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33640025/86590269-8e7ce600-bf8f-11ea-9f4b-18d25d242e5a.png",alt:"Screenshot"}})]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"the-future"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#the-future"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" The future")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("For the future I have planned to extend the app a little with those features:")]),e._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[e._v("Establish proper mobile layout (maybe pwa, never did that before though)")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("Chache selections")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("Let users favourite meals & canteens")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("Implement sharing-option for meals")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("Fix security issues in node-modules")])]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"check-it-out"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#check-it-out"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Check it out!")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Check out the "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://mensa.yannickspoerl.de",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("live-app"),a("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" or check the out the code "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/YannickSpoerl/mensavue",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("on GitHub"),a("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(".")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
