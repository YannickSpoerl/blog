## Who are you?

As you found this website already, you might have guessed, that my name is Yannick. I'm a computer science student from Germany and my field of interests
are web-development, especially JavaScript-Frameworks. Mainly I work with Vue.js, but I also have experience in Angular and similar frameworks.
I'm enrolled at TU Dresden, where I am currently working on my bachelors-thesis, which is about abstract argumentation. From that, you can guess,
that besides frontend-development, I'm really into logic and theoretical computer science. I'm also a firm believer into linux and the open-source community,
which is why I always try to share every bit of code I work on!

## What is this?

This is my personal blog, where I post about anything related to computer science. Being a student, while working as a part-time software-developer means,
that there is not a lot of time left to follow every single interesting idea I might encounter, even though there is a lot of input and ideas floating around
all the time. When there is enough time, I always try to pursue promising ideas and write some code myself, leading to many small projects happening besides
my studies. This blog is exactly the place, where I try to share and explain interesting stuff I encounter along the road to becoming a "real" computer scientist.
Happy reading!
