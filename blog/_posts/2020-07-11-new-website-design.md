# New website design ü•≥

After rebuilding this personal blog with Vuepress and settling on a shiny new design and logo, it was time to do the same with my
personal website [yannickspoerl.de](https://www.yannickspoerl.de)!

## The new features

I had some wishes in the back of my mind of what new functionalities I wanted and I'm glad that everything turned out working
exactly as I wanted! So I'm proud to announce the new changes:

- Complete new look and styling
- Multi-language support (currently English and German)
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Interactive scroller

## Powered by?

My previous website was built with Jekyll, which was very developer-friendly and did it's job very well. But for
more functionality, flexibility and a well-structured codebase it would not be my first choice again. As I'm a Vue developer
I built my new website as a Vue-app. That went pretty well and I was nearly completely satisfied by my new draft, but
some edge-cases regarding the routing gave me headaches.

So I looked around again and on a steed came my noble knight
to save me: Nuxt üôè. Nuxt is a real powerhouse in the Vue world and it enabled me to build exactly what I wanted:
A Vue application, with integrated internationalization, routing, asset handling, layouts, pages and static file
generation. So I quickly transferred my already written layouts, did some adjustments, wrote a small config and
voil√†: my website was ready to be deployed.

## My personal conclusion

My fresh new website is online and I learned the Nuxt-basics and I can say: Nuxt is the real shit. I stayed with vanilla Vue
for a long time, only using UI-frameworks or smaller modules, but Nuxt is very powerful while still flexible and
easy to maintain. I will definitely use it again and I encourage everyone who likes rapid Vue development to try it out!
