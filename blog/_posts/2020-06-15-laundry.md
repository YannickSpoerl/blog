## Laundry

## Some background

I live in a shared flat for some years now, and as some of you might already know from their own experience, doing laundry
can become a problem once in a while. Sometimes you really need some clean shirts, but one of your flatmates already started the laundry-machine. You could wait the two hours, until its finished but then the laundry needs to sit a day or two on the laundry rack to
properly dry, so you have to wait two days until you can wash your shirts, but then there is the next mate, who really needs to do laundry.

The obvious solution is to talk to each other and to do laundry together, so no one has to wear the same underpants 3 times in a row, but
as it turns out it is annoying to communicate about a trivial thing like laundry everyday, especially if not everybody is at home.
So why not use an app, that everbody can access everytime to plan laundry together?

## The use case

In our flat we have already used an app for some time, but it was lacking some important features, so I decided to write a fancy new app,
that satisfies all our needs. Our old app could already:

- Create laundry with laundy-color, temperature and date
- Participate in a planned laundry
- Indicate that your clothes are in the machine
- Mark laundry as finished

**But it was missing**:

- Accessibility outside of our network (you only can plan laundry if you are at home anyway)
- Mark the machine as full
- Get notifications when a new laundry got planned

## The stack

As I am a Vue developer I decided to write the app with **Vue** as frontend and **Firebase** as backend. I used **Vuex** for state management and **Vuexfire** to keep the data in the frontend in sync with the data in the database. The UI-Component library **Vuetify** provided a solid interface once again. This time I also used the PWA-quickstarter provided by the Vue-CLI. PWA is short for **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pp, meaning not only the interface is compatible with mobile devices, but also the app inherits App-like properties on smartphones. As it turns out, this is quite handy, as even though the app itself lives in the browser and can be accessed via internet such as a usual website, a user can install it on his smartphone, the app works in an offline environment (obviously you can just view the data, that was last available) and the user receives notifications like from a native app.

And here is what the final product looks like:

## Conclusion

It was really fun to develop this app, because I got the opportunity to use some new libraries and become familiar with how they work, while the end-product was a ready-to-use app that is in use daily for some time now in our flat and makes our live a lot easier.
