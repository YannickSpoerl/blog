# Hackaburg Regensburg 2019

## What is Hackaburg?

Hackaburg, the Hackathon @ TechBase in Regensburg was from 24.5. to 25.5 and my team, friends from university, and me took part. It was the first hackathon for all of us and with small expectations but big anticipation we took the journey from Dresden the day before and stayed overnight to be at the venue on friday morning. 

## What happened?

After the initial introduction, pitches and lunch we started coding midday. We had a few breaks for eating in the ball pit or playing some mario cart, but worked hard though the entire night until the coding freeze saturday midday. After a few 5 minutes introductions to the judges our team and project was selected to present it to the complete audience as one of the 12 final teams. As the event had 5 main tracks, meaning types and/or purposes of application, each sponsored by one company, one winner for each track was to be chosen. Each of the final teams had exactly 3 minutes to pitch, show and explain what we have worked for the past 24 hours. We were a bit nervous as we were really tired and Hackaburg being the first event of its kind we participated in but did okay and so we won our track "Digital Insurance"! We were really happy about our final prototype and of course about winning. So on Sunday we went home not only tired and exhausted but also loaded with goodies, good food in our belly, the winning prize and happy!

## And what did you build?

Our prototype was a chatbot powered by the conversational ai from sap, an own fancy front-end in angular and a powerful backend in javas spring-boot. The application was able to have a smart and funny chat with the user, ask him relevant questions until suggesting him the perfect insurance for his needs, all while persisting the data and knowing when to ask what questions.

Afterall it was for me one of the best weekends I ever had, the event itself and its challenges were fun, the organizers did a great job in providing food, accomodation, goodies and fun side-events. My teammates did a really good job as well and we had much fun while working, so I would repeat weekends like this anytime again with my mates and am thrilled about doing stuff like this again soon!
