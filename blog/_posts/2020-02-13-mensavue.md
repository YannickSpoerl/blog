# MensaVue 2.0

## Some background

Some time has passed sinced I presented the first version of my web-application "MensaVue", which was my first try at the JavaScript Frontend-Framework VueJS. The app basically fetches canteens and their corresponding meals from the OpenMensa-API and lets the user select, browse and filter those. At the time I included the Vue-files via CDN and wrote the app entirely as one index.html file. It worked okay, but as you might guess this is a nice approach for a small prototype to test the framework,
but in terms of structure, readabilty and extensibility a middle-scaled catastrophe. As I progressed in my work with frontend-development and especially within Vue I gained some experience and made a note in the back of my mind to re-write this nice application in the proper Vue-way some day.
Currently I am in my exam-phase from university and had a bit of stress, but I did the rewrite now anyway and had some fun, also the application runs a bit better now, is open to more development and looks a lot better!

## The implementation

Here is what I did:

- Re-wrote the app with using .vue-components and a proper stucture
- implemented some small new features
- used Vuetify Material Design components (again)
- used webpack as minifier and bundler
- set up proper github-pages branch and "deploy-pipeline" (a shell script lol)

As already said, Im proud of this new better and more stable version, that allows implementing new features way easier.

Here is what it looks like now:

## The future

For the future I have planned to extend the app a little with those features:

- Establish proper mobile layout (maybe pwa, never did that before though)
- Chache selections
- Let users favourite meals & canteens
- Implement sharing-option for meals
- Fix security issues in node-modules
