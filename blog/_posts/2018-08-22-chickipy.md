# ChickiPy

A little python script I wrote in a quiet minute, that replaces every noun with
"chicken", which results in hilarious texts!

```python
  # call script with $python3 "Path/To/File/To/Chickify.txt"
  import os
  import sys
  import re
  
  
  def chicken():
      try:
          path = sys.argv[1]
      except:
          print("No path to file given!")
          return
      if path[len(path)-4:len(path)] != ".txt":
          print("File not .txt")
          return
      rel_path = os.path.relpath(path, os.getcwd())
      if not os.path.exists(rel_path):
          print("File doesn't exist or path is wrong")
          return
      with open(rel_path, "r") as text_file:
          content = text_file.read()
          all_words = re.sub("[^\w]", " ", content).split()
      upper_case_words = []
      for word in all_words:
          if word[0].isupper():
              upper_case_words.append(word)
      for word in upper_case_words:
          content = content.replace(word, "Chicken")
      write_file = open(os.path.dirname(path) + "/chicken.txt", "w")
      write_file.write(content)
  
  
  chicken()
```
