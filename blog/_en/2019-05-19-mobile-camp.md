## What happened?

On 18. and 19. May I attended the Mobile Camp Dresden 2019 at the Faculty of  Computer Science, TU Dresden. Not knowing about the Bar Camp philosophy I came with little expectations and was really surprised about the variety of content and input we gathered in only 2 days! The program at Bar Camps is designed by the participants and the organizer just provided location, catering and the time schedule. Each day started with a keynote, one about AI in Logistics by IBM and the other one about the use of blockchain in Web 3.0 by evan, both very interesting talks. After that everyone could suggest topics they would like to talk about in one of the 45min sessions during the day and get feedback by the audience.
The sessions I attended were all very interesting and covered some different perspectives of (mobile) developing:

Overall I loved the idea and the event itself and I will make sure to attend the next Mobile Camp in Dresden and maybe some other Bar Camps somewhere else!
Thanks to the organizers and the nice and helpful people!
