summary: How to install iOS Apps on your old device

## When is this useful?

So recently I tried to install the Spotify-App on my old iPod-Touch 4th generation. As Apple stopped supporting old devices, the iPod still runs with iOS 6.xxx and as most Apps require some 9.xxx version of iOS nowadays it would not let me install Spotify through the App-Store. But I figured out a way to get the last compatible version of any App from the Store and want to share it here:

## The Steps

- STEP 1: Download the oldest version of iTunes for your OS from [https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes](https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes), for me it is 10.7.
- STEP 2: Sign in with the same Apple-ID as your device in the store
- STEP 3: Download the desired App from the store to your computer, note that there is no need to connect you iOS device or similar
- STEP 4: Now go into the App-Store of your iOS device and open the "My Purchases"-section
- STEP 5: Your App should be at the top of the list, click install
- STEP 6: Now it should tell you, that the App is not compatible with your current iOS-version but that there is an older version that is compatible and asks if you want to install it. Just press "Yes" and your done!
    
Hope this little guide helps, took me quite a time to figure it all out so maybe this saves somebody some time :-)
