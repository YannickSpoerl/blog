## Introduction

Welcome to **"Introduction to Abstract Argumentation"**, part **1**!
At the moment of writing im nearly done with writing my bachelors thesis, which is about abstract argumentation. I did not know anything about this topic before starting my thesis but quickly gained some basic knowledge and discovered my interest for this topic.

Since the aquiration of knowledge about the basic concepts of abstract argumentation took a lot of time of reading research paper and I still see things from the beginners perspective I want to share my insights in short and easy to understand blog posts.

**Important disclaimer:** I will refrain from citing most of the time and might instead post links to relevant papers at the bottom of posts. So be careful when using this posts as a reference, especially in an academic context. I can not guarantee (mathematical) correctness, even though I will try to be as accurate as possible.

## What is abstract argumentation?
Let's dive into the topic and clear the question of what I want to talk about! Abstract argumentation is a research topic residing in the field of artificial intelligence. It was initiaded by Dung in 1995 in a now popular and often cited paper. The basic idea is to model a problem in the form of arguments and attacks between them. As the name abstract argumentation tells, we are dealing with abstracted arguments, meaning the contents of them are no longer relevant in the stage we deal with them. Let us take a look at a simplified example:

Suppose it is afternoon and I want to surprise my friend who has his birthday. I am debating where I am to find him most likely, since I know some of his habits:

- **a**: On his birthday he usually takes a day off from work.
- **b**: He often leaves work at midday.
- **c**: He usually is working at the office during the day.
- **d**: He likes to take a walk at the park.

Let us think about that a moment. I know that my friend likes to take a walk at the park as argument $d$ states, but I also know that he has to work during the day, so argument $c$ attacks argument $d$ and he is more likely to be at the office than in the park. But I also know that he took a free day from work on his birthday in the past years, so argument $a$ attacks argument $c$ and he is probably not at his office. Further it is already afternoon and he often is finished with work by now anyway: argument $b$ also attacks argument $c$.

What we are dealing with here is a so called argumentation framework. Our arguments are represented by the set $Ar = \lbrace a, b, c, d\rbrace$. Our attacks are represented by the relation $att = \lbrace(a,c), (b,c), (c,d)\rbrace$. An argumentation framework is now the combination of the arguments and the attacks: $AF = (Ar, att)$.

It is now fairly obvious to depict this framework as directed graph, the usual way to illustrate frameworks. For our framework the graph looks like this:

We have now taken the first step towards abstract argumentation, which is the content of the first post of this series.
If you are interested in the mathematical and theoretical background of this post you might want to take a look at [Dung's paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029400041X) from 1995. Otherwise stay tuned for the next post!
